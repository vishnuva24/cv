I have felt a closeness for Mathematics right from middle school, indulging myself in the subject as completely as possible. Engaging with maths beyond the school since early, though learning about the Olympiad topics like number theory and geometry, made it very easy to fall in love with the subject. It was in 8th grade, the whole of which I studied Euclidean geometry, that I started going down the mathematics rabbit hole. It was through this that I realised my passion for the kind of thought and curiosity this subject demands. Further during my preparation for the JEE, I was curious to understand aspects of the subject beyond neat tricks and computation, or rather where these ideas taught to me connected. 

I started my undergraduate degree at Ashoka with an uncertainty about my major, but a certainty for wanting mathematical interactions. Through taking CS courses and sitting in on physics courses, I realised the true universality of maths, which made me want to study the subject even more. I took the standard courses like Linear Algebra, Calculus-1,2, Analysis, and Algebra, which further indulged my interests. I couldn't point out to a specific area that I want to study, as I feel I haven't seen enough math yet. Also, that which I have seen, I find myself truly interested in all of it. But, if asked to pinpoint, my exploration outside the courses in Algebra has been fun and I want to learn more about it. I have been sitting in on courses and talks to learn more. I want to learn more about Representation theory, Algebraic topology, and algebraic number theory. 

As for learning outside courses through projects, I try to engage with opportunities around me. Under Professor Sagar Shrivastava and the Lodha Genius Programme, I wrote an expository paper on Calculus on Manifolds, hoping to engage further with geometry. I have also been curious about the applied side of things, I am currently exploring probability, machine learning and reinforcement learning by taking courses and interacting with the Centre for Data, Learning and Decision Sciences under Professor Sandeep Juneja. I am attending a discussion group on diffusion models.

I have also been lucky to have interacted with an amazing set of professors, faculty and fellow students at Ashoka whose teaching, openness and interest in the subject have boosted my engagement with it. Above specific courses I've taken and things I've explored, I find that what I like the most about math is the conversations it allows me to have. All good memories of the subject seem to have this commonality of arising from a conversation or a person I enjoyed talking to that subject about, and view things from their perspective. I am thankful for these, and intend to make the most of this programme by doing this. For this, I think IMSC will be a perfect opportunity for me to continue this pursuit of mine in math.
